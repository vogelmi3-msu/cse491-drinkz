Michelle's Feature:

Summary:
I will be supporting the calcualtion of the cost of a drink.
Given a recipe(s) and an inventory, you will be able to calculate the
cost of the recipe(s).

Stories:

A: Michelle wants to make a long-island ice tea with the alcohol in her
inventory, but wants to know how much the drink itself is worth. This
will allow her to decide if it is cheaper in the long run to purchase
her alcohol and drink at home or go to the bar.

B: Maddy knows that it is cheaper to make drinks at home and at the
bar but wants to show her roomates at the co-op how much $$ they will
save by drinking at home.

Features:
1. Find a database that has the price of the liquor, and store it in
our database/give our database/app access to it
2. Given a recipe, find out how much it costs to make. If there are
multiple options for a given ingredient (well vs top shelf) give all
the permutations of the cost of the drink.
3. Web interface that can be used to caclulate the price of a given
recipe (might automatically give average price for each recipe)
4. Have JSON-RPC functions that given a recipe will return the
average cost of making said recipe.
